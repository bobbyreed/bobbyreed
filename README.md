# So it goes — A Digital Workshop 

I'm bobby reed, a computer science instructor at [Oklahoma City University](https://www.okcu.edu/faculty/bobby-reed-m-s) with 15 years of experience wrangling technology for educational and cultural purposes. My work lives at the intersection of **emerging technologies**, **historical preservation**, and **educational innovation**.

## 🎯 Current Focus

- **Augmenting university research** with emerging technologies
- **Building spatial applications** for preservation and research purposes
- Making **old things new again** through the magic of code

## 🏛️ Featured Projects

### Virtual Heritage Experiences

#### 🎷 [VirtualDeepDeuce](https://github.com/yourusername/VirtualDeepDeuce)
A VR experience commissioned by the Metropolitan Library System that recreates Oklahoma City's historic Deep Deuce district—the heart of the city's African American community and jazz scene in the 1920s and '30s. Where legends like Jimmy Rushing and Charlie Christian made their names, and where Ralph Ellison grew up before writing "Invisible Man."

#### 🎪 [virtual-fairgrounds-web](https://github.com/yourusername/virtual-fairgrounds-web)
Step into 1950s Oklahoma City through your browser. This JavaScript-powered recreation of the Fairgrounds Neighborhood democratizes historical preservation—no expensive VR equipment required, just curiosity and an internet connection.

### Educational Tools

#### 📚 [student-picker](https://github.com/yourusername/student-picker)
A Godot-built application that transforms classroom management and assessment into something more systematic and fair. Because even in education, randomness serves a purpose—it keeps everyone honest and attentive.

#### 🎨 [three-js-gh-pages-template](https://github.com/yourusername/three-js-gh-pages-template)
The scaffolding that makes 3D web projects possible without the usual setup headaches. Save hours of configuration, spend time on the interesting problems instead.

## 📚 Teaching Philosophy

The most interesting problems exist not in the latest frameworks or programming languages, but in the **spaces between disciplines**—where history meets code, where libraries meet virtual reality, and where teaching meets technology.

## 🎯 Current Research Interests

- **Spatial computing** for cultural preservation
- **Immersive educational experiences** using VR/AR
- **Accessible technology** for public institutions
