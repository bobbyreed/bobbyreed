# Welcome to my Digital Workshop

I'm bobby reed, a computer science instructor at [Oklahoma City University](https://www.okcu.edu/faculty/bobby-reed-m-s) who believes technology should enable humans to do things they didn't think they could.

## What I Do

I build bridges between what was and what could be—using code to make archives breathe, history dance, and education more equitable. Whether I'm recreating neighborhoods from the past in VR or ensuring every student gets called on fairly, my work lives at one intersection: **furthering human capability through technology**.
